// Derive an algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
// Implement your algorithm using recursion. 
// Your program should display each movement of the disk from one rod to another.

// If you are given 5 disks, how do the rods look like after 7 recursive calls?
// How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks? with 4 disks? with 5 disks?
// What is the runtime of your algorithm?
